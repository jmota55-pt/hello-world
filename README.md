# About Me
**Name**: Joel\
**Career Path**: Research Professor at an R1 University or Research Ecologist at a Federal Institution\
**Random Adventure**: My friends and I recently went to Pittsburgh for some shopping and got some Sichuan Cuisine from (Chendu Gourmet II) which was very good. Then we went stopped by Sarris candy store in Canonsburg, PA and got some ice cream. ***Delicious*** ice cream that is also affordable.

## My Goal
I want to be a part of the the online R community and learn how to use Github with R to help better organize my own work and build toward achiving my own professional goals.
